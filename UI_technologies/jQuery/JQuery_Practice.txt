# JQuery 

Every HTML element has a parent element from which it inherits properties.


1) ready function is run as soons as the page is loaded
2) All jQuery statements start with the $ sign
3) jquery generally manipulates html elements
4) Use the dot operator for selecting classes from the html elements just like CSS
5) For selecting elements with id make use of the hash operator  just like in the case of CSS
 You can select all of the elements in the HTML by the following way
 a) to select the class just use the dot operator, like ".class"
 b) To select the element with an id associated make use of the # operator like "#id"
 c) To select the entire set of html elements do it as the following example, "button" selects all the button elements

Most of the scenarios there will not be neat id's to work with, jQury has another way aroung dealing with this
jQuery uses CSS Selectors to target elements. target:nth-child(M) css selector allows you to select all the Mth elements with the target class or element type.
Example for a div element is as below
    $("#left-well:nth-child(2)").addClass("bounce");
    $("#right-well:nth-child(2)").addClass("bounce");
You can also use nth child in cases where you have named your ids accordinto some numerical pattern
Suppose you have ids as target1, target2 and target3, then to selct the target 2 element you can use  $(".target:nth-child(2)") and later perform actions on it

Similarly you can select even and odd elements accordingly, to select the odd elements use $(".target:odd"), Note that jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element, fourth element, and so on.


 IN general
 1) for selcting an element it is one of ("button") or ("#id") or (".class"), 
 2) Once the particular element is selected then you go ahead and do some operations on them

 Some of the useful classes of jquery, each of these classes can be applied once the classes are selected from the above mentioned method
Function chaining is an important concept in jQury and many of the belwo functions can be chained together, this is one of the most important features of jQuery

 a) prop()
 b) addClass()
 c) removeClass()
 d) html()
 e) text()
 f) remove()
 g) appendTo()
 h) clone()
 i) parent()
 j) children()
