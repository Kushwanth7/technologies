Bootstrap grid system in a short note
1) Rows must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding
2) These rows must be used for creating horizontal group of columns 
3) Any content should be placed within the columns and only columns should be immediate children of the rows
4) You can use pre-defined classes like .row and .col-xs-4 for making the grid layouts
5) There should be 12 columns, for example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4. For each row the columns must add upto 12

Basic grid structure for Twitter Bootstrap is as below

<div class = "container">
   
   <div class = "row">
      <div class = "col-*-*"></div>
      <div class = "col-*-*"></div>
   </div>
   
   <div class = "row">...</div>
	
</div>

<div class = "container">
   ....
</div>
