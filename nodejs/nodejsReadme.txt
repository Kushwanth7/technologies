# Readme for Node.js

Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based framework/platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications.


Node.js is a server side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine). 

Features of Node.js
Some of the important features of node.js are as below

Asynchronous and Event Driven - All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.

Very Fast - Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Single Threaded but Highly Scalable - Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.

No Buffering - Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.


Where to use Node.js
Node.js can be used best in any of the below applications
1) I/O bound Applications

2) Data Streaming and Data Intensive Real time Applications

3) JSON API based Applications and Single Page Applications

Node.js should generally not be used in CPU intensive applications
